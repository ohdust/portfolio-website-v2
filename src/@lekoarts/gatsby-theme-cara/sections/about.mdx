Hello World. I'm Ashley.

I care about understanding and representing business needs by focusing on the end-user's experience.

In my undergrad, I attended Eastern Michigan University where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics and was the president of Women in Computer Science (WiCS), a club for women studying computing. 

Previous work experience includes working as a full stack developer at a consultant firm for fortune 500 companies as well as working for CitiGroup, 
where I was a software Javascript/Java developer for an application used within Citi around the world and 
as an analyst working on supporting the business aspect of the team.

In my freetime, I like to learn new technologies and read up on the latest.
